A PhD position is available in the lab of Dr. Minh Bui, <https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/bui-m>, at the Research School of Computer Science, Australian National University (ANU). We are looking for a highly motivated student, who will work on the next generation of models and methods for phylogenetic analysis in the genomic era. There are a large number of potential directions that the research could take, and the details will depend on your interests and experience. Potential directions include: developing efficient algorithms for tree search; new approaches to phylogenetic model selection; co-estimating multiple trees. The student will implement new models and methods in the widely used IQ-TREE software (<http://www.iqtree.org>).

The ANU campus is situated in the heart of Australia’s capital city, Canberra, which is ranked as the third best city in the world according to Lonely Planet (2018) and is Australia’s most liveable city (Life in Australia Report 2019). The ANU has an international reputation for research excellence and is ranked among the best universities in the world (QS World University Ranking 2019).

Candidates: ANU scholarships are highly competitive, and cover all fees and a ~$27K stipend. In order to be put forward, you will need outstanding undergraduate marks and a first class honours or Masters by research (or be expecting to gain one by the middle of 2020) or equivalent research experience. 

To apply, please send to m.bui (at) anu.edu.au a detailed CV, full academic transcripts, and a brief description of your research interests and how they intersect with this project. 

The deadline is January 31, 2020.
